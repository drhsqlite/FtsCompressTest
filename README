USAGE:

	testfts supports three options:
		1. -w: For building database without compression
		2. -c: For building database with compression
		3. -s: For searching the database. This option takes a mandatory argument,
				which is the search query itself. On successful execution it
				should output snippet of some of the results.

	Producing the Bug:
		1. First build the database without the compression option:
			$./testfts -w
		
		2. Next, search for something. For example:
			$./testfts -s "apropos"
			
			You should see some search results on the terminal.
		
		3. Now, rebuild the database with the compression option:
			$./testfts -c
			
		4. Again, perform a search query:
			$./testfts -s "apropos"
			
			No output.
			
	Workaround:
		Alter the form of the SQL query from:
			"SELECT snippet(fts) FROM fts WHERE fts MATCH(query) AND i = 0"
		with this:
			"SELECT snippet(fts) from fts WHERE fts MATCH(query) AND i like '0'"
